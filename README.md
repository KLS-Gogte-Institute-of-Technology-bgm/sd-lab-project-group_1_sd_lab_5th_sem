# Movie Recommender System
A recommender system, or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications.

We built a Movie Recommender System such it is open to any user to either login or create a new account. Once the credentials are accounted for, he/she is given a list of movies to select from. This way he/she can also rate the selected movie and once he/she has finished watching the movie it is added to the watched movie list. Hence the recommended list is updated with a new set for the user.


To run the Movie Recommender System - Run the script `driver.py`
